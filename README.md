## Overview

My task was to build out the responsive landing page project to the designs inside the `/design` folder, and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

- See a list of their shortened links, even after refreshing the browser✅
- Copy the shortened link to their clipboard in a single click✅
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - The `input` field is empty✅
